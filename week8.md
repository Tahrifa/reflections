The research paper is on a survey of scholarly data visualization. 
Scholarly data contain abundant academic resources such as scholarly documents (i.e., papers, books, patents, and scientific reports) as well as associated data including information of authors, citations, figures, tables. 
The process of scholarly data visualization combines the theory of scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics.
Popular datasets are DBLP(DataBase systems and Logic Programming), APS (American Physical Society), MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph), and ORC (Open Research Corpus).
Figure 3 shows the number of advisees and their advisors between 63 countries on the world map which is generated by Tableau. It maps the advisees from different countries in different colors. 
FIGURE 4 shows Word cloud of the advisor-advisee data visualized by Infogram. The sizes of the countriesâ€™ names show the total number of advisors/advisees.
FIGURE 5 shows Number of advisors and advisees for different countries drawn by RAW Graphs. Circles from inside to outside represent: the number of advisors, countries, and the number of advisees, respectively.
FIGURE 6 shows different networks for various scholarly entities and their relationships visualized by using D3.js
Various visualization tools are discussed here. Vosviewer,  bibexcel, citespace are some of the visual analytic tools. 
Fig 16 shows Bibliographic coupling of the 20 most productive countries/regions in TFS publications in VOSviewer. 
The biggest circle represents China, which means that China is the most productive country, and the second is the United States. 
Scholarly data visualization is important in addressing the problems arising from large-volume, multivariety, and important-value data. 
Two major challenges are how to integrate information from the complex scholarly data efficiently and how to combine various visualization techniques with the analysis processing more suitably.
