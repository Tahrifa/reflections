The name of the research paper is Visualization of Water Services in Africa : Data Applications for Nexus Governance.
The graph shows soil–water index of South and Central Africa.
It highlights the level of soil–water in the root zone.
In Africa the water resources are spatially unequally distributed. 
In combination with varying population density, this results in wide differences in water availability and poses challenges for water supply.
Soil–water indices are used as proxies for soil–water content.
This inﬂuences plant growth and inﬁltration capacity that is ﬂood protection.
It can also an be used for drought prediction.
Different colors indicate different levels here.
For example, in South Africa most areas are in Wilting (less than or equal to 10) and Stress (10 to 50) levels. 
Near Central Africa most places like, Madagascar, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambiq are in Sufficient and Satisfactory levels.
