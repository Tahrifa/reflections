In this paper the author has tried to introduce the field of multiple and coordinated views.
Multiple views are not merely isolated separate views on data but mighty tools which often share a relationship. 
This relationship is brought to attention and utilized by coordination. 
Hence, in this paper he presents an outline of the field of multiple coordinated views, its reasons, anticipations, jargon and examples. 
Because of its general nature, a large portion of this text deals with abstract formalizations, models and architecture descriptions. 
The latter is mainly revolving around user-generated coordination. 
In fig. 8 window placement reflects location on map.
The main subject of this research paper will be an analysis of different concepts and descriptions revolving around MCV, following a description of (historic) ideas to formalize and generalize coordination based on these classifications and an introduction of a small collection of specific MCV systems.
Here, the works of North and Schneiderman (Snap-Together Visualization), Boukhelifa (A Coordination Model for Exploratory Multiview Visualization) and Weaver (Improvise) get major focus as they address coordination itself in different views and show development in their field. 
To conclude this paper, a small collections of interesting uses of multiple and coordinated views is presented as well as a brief discussion on recent issues.
