The paper is about IBM Watson.
Watson is a super computer system.
Watson, a cognitive computing technology, has been conﬁgured to support life sciences research. 
Figure 3 shows Watson depicting gene relationships to multiple sclerosis. 
This is an example of a network of genesthat Watson has produced in real time when a user types in a disease name. 
Watson generatesthese network maps in real time, using its annotators to extract the relationships between any geneand multiple sclerosis out of >26 million MEDLINE abstracts.
Figure 4 shows Watson Discovery Advisor applied to Life Sciences. 
This is a depiction of the architecture Watsonleverages when being applied to the life sciences domain including the aggregation of data, therecognition of major scientiﬁc concepts and then an interface that enables a researcher to explore.
WatsonDiscovery Advisor has been applied in several pilot projects. 
Cognitive computing solutions patterned after severalkey aspects of human thought are emerging in manyindustries. 
Their ability to ingest varieties of data andto understand, evaluate, and learn from the data hasthe potential to unlock novel insights. 
These solutionsmay enhance areas such as Life Sciences, which are indire need of accelerated innovation.
