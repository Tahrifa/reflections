The name of the paper is Techniques for Flexible Responsive Visualization Design.
This paper explores the design of responsive visualizations that adapt the visualization design to different device sizes. 
They perform a survey of 231 responsive visualizations from twelve news organizations to examine existing responsive practices and further describe formative interviews with five authors about their design process and rationale.
From the formative interviews, they identify four design guidelines and contribute a set of core system features to support the design of responsive visualizations. 
Our system displays multiple views for different device contexts and foregrounds design variation to provide a complete picture of the responsive techniques applied. 
Designers can construct visualizations using both simultaneous global edits or local customizations to the designs. 
In figure 7 you can see that the designers may also customize the behavior of end-user interactions with the visualization. 
In this case, the designer specifies a dropdown interaction to update the line color and stroke width of the visualization. 
These customizations appear when the end-user interacts with a dropdown. 
However, the customizations are similarly displayed alongside the other encodings and customizations in the attributes panel.
Finally, they reproduce four real-world examples selected from their earlier survey. 
In contrast to the existing linear workflows described in the formative interviews, these examples demonstrate the expressiveness and flexibility of the system for supporting the iterative design of responsive visualizations.
